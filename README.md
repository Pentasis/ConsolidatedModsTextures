# Consolidated Mods: Textures (& GUI)

This mod is one part of a larger collection I call the **Consolidated Mods** series.

## What's the Story Behind 'Consolidated Mods'?

Like many Rimworld players, I have a very particular way I like to play. I'd describe my style as "realistic simulation" or perhaps "QoL+", which is to say I love the vanilla game but enjoy enhancing it with sensible tweaks and improvements. Of course, what one person considers a "minor tweak" is another's game-breaking feature!

I grew weary of the endless cycle of waiting for mod updates, seeing great mods get abandoned, or installing a mod for one feature only to get ten others I didn't want. My solution was to start tinkering. This quickly escalated from a few private forks to completely rewriting and consolidating my favourite features into one glorious, monolithic mod.

Eventually, that single mod became a bit of a behemoth. So, I've carved it up into this series of smaller, more focused mods, each tackling a different aspect of the game.

A few mates persuaded me to publish them, so here we are. I'm only publishing the modules where I've rewritten the code from the ground up, so you can be sure no code was simply copied from other authors. However, the *ideas* were often inspired by their brilliant work, and I've done my best to credit them accordingly. If I've missed anyone, please do give me a nudge so I can correct the oversight!

No AI was used to write code, but I did use AI to generate the thumbnail image.

## About Consolidated Mods: Textures

This module is all about the visuals. A fresh coat of paint for your colony. It is purely cosmetic and focuses on two things:

- Adding minor, helpful elements to the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- Changing or tweaking various in-game textures.

Rest assured, it changes absolutely nothing about the gameplay itself. It's all sizzle and no steak, by design!

NOTE: This module is not published on the STeam Workshop because unlike the other moodules, this one does contain work made by others I just copy-pasted.

## All the mods in this series:

### Consolidated Mods: Medical

This module is the colony's chief medical officer. It's all about health, medicine, and the general physical well-being of your pawns. It introduces sensible changes and additions to things like:

- Medical procedures and surgeries.
- Tending to injuries and the progression of diseases.
- How prosthetics and bionics function and are applied.

The goal is to add a touch more depth and logic to keeping your colonists in one piece, without requiring you to get a medical degree to understand it.

### Consolidated Mods: Combat

This module is your settlement's drill sergeant and chief strategist. It focuses entirely on combat and defence, tweaking everything from how cover and armour function to the behaviour of raiders and the effectiveness of your turrets. The aim is to make firefights more tactical and defences more meaningful, without turning every raid into a slog.

### Consolidated Mods: Behaviour

This module is the colony's psychologist and social worker. It delves into the minds of your colonists, tweaking how they act, interact, and make decisions. It covers social relationships, recreational activities, and what drives them to their breaking points. It's designed to make your pawns feel a little more rational and their behaviour more intuitive, hopefully leading to fewer "why on earth did you do that?!" moments.

### Consolidated Mods: Farming

This module pulls on its wellies and gets its hands dirty. It's all about your colony's food chain and relationship with nature, from farming and forestry to ranching and hunting. The changes here are designed to make building a self-sufficient colony more engaging and logical, whether you're sowing fields, taming thrumbos, or managing your livestock.

### Consolidated Mods: Work

This module is the colony's foreman and efficiency expert. It overhauls the systems related to pawn labour, from the 'Work' tab itself to how skills and passions influence their jobs. The goal is to make managing your workforce more intuitive and give you finer, more logical control over who does what, and when.

### Consolidated Mods: Hauling

This module tackles one of the most crucial, yet often frustrating, parts of colony life: moving things from A to B. It is laser-focused on improving the logic behind hauling and carrying. It's packed with sensible tweaks to make your entire supply chain run that much smoother, reducing busywork and freeing up your colonists for more important tasks.

### Consolidated Mods: Planet

This module zooms out from the day-to-day survival to look at the bigger picture. It's all about your colony's place in the wider world, focusing on faction interactions, trade, diplomacy, and travel. The aim is to make the world map feel more alive and interacting with your neighbours a more dynamic and interesting part of the game.

### Consolidated Mods: Tweaks

This module is the 'everything drawer' of the collection. It contains all the small but significant quality-of-life gameplay changes that don't neatly fit into any of the other modules. Think of it as a collection of minor adjustments that you might not notice at first, but soon won't be able to play without. Itâ€™s a miscellany of good ideas, all bundled together to smooth out the remaining rough edges of the vanilla experience.
